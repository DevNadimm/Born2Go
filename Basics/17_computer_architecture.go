# 💻 COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE & HISTORY

## 📘 1. COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

Main Components of a Computer:
1️⃣ CPU — Central Processing Unit
2️⃣ RAM — Random Access Memory
3️⃣ ROM — Read Only Memory

🧠 CPU (Central Processing Unit)
• Known as the “brain” of the computer.
• Performs arithmetic and logical operations (+, -, *, /, &&, ||, !).
• Contains important registers such as:

* Program Counter (PC)
* Instruction Pointer (IP)
  which help control the execution of instructions.

⚡ RAM (Random Access Memory)
• Primary (volatile) memory — data is lost when power is off.
• Used for temporary data storage and quick access.
• Holds programs and data currently in use.

💾 ROM (Read Only Memory)
• Permanent (non-volatile) memory — retains data even when powered off.
• Stores firmware and essential boot instructions.

## 📚 2. HISTORY OF COMPUTERS

📍 2700 BC — *Abacus*: The first known calculating device.
📍 1600s — *Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz*: Introduced binary logic (0 & 1).
📍 1800s — *Charles Babbage*: Invented the *Analytical Engine*,
known as the father of modern computers.
📍 *Ada Lovelace*: Recognized as the first computer programmer.
📍 1930s — *Alan Turing*: Created the concept of the *Turing Machine*,
foundation of modern computing.

## ⚙️ 3. GENERATIONS OF COMPUTERS

1️⃣ **First Generation (1940–1956)**

* Used vacuum tubes.
* Example: ENIAC — first general-purpose electronic computer.

2️⃣ **Second Generation (1956–1963)**

* Used transistors.
* Smaller, faster, more reliable.

3️⃣ **Third Generation (1964–1971)**

* Introduced Integrated Circuits (ICs).
* Start of commercial computing (IBM era).

4️⃣ **Fourth Generation (1971–Present)**

* Based on microprocessors (e.g., Intel 4004, 1971).
* Rise of PCs, Intel, Apple, Microsoft, and the software industry.

5️⃣ **Fifth Generation (Present & Future)**

* Based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing.
* Focused on ultra-fast and intelligent computation.

## 🌐 4. MODERN COMPUTING

• Use of multi-core CPUs and GPUs for parallel processing.
• Widespread cloud-based and Internet-driven systems.
• Modern OS ecosystems: Windows, macOS, Linux.
• Quantum computers aim to solve complex problems faster than ever.
